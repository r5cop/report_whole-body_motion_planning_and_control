%Abstract &
%	The whole-body control method only operates at a local scope and therefore suffers of local minima. Therefore, a planner is required that provides connectivity information at a global scope while constraining only the DoFs that are relevant for the task at hand. This work presents a topological planner for manipulation, where the topological graph is an abstract representation of possible robot configurations that describes possible sequences of motions. \\
