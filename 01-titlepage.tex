Abstract &
	Whole-body control is a promising control method for domestic service robots. However, since
whole-body control is a potential field-based method, it only operates at a local scope and it
might therefore be unable to find a global solution in a complex environment with local minima.
Therefore, to integrate a whole-body controller with a task executer, a planner is required that
provides connectivity information at a global scope while constraining only the DoFs that are
relevant for the (sub-task) at hand. The contribution of this work is to apply a topological
planner for manipulation, where the topological graph is an abstract representation of possible
robot configurations that describes possible sequences of motions. All nodes in the topological
graph are grounded to specific end-effector attractors. Each attractor can constrain up to six
DoFs and possesses a number of properties, such as the target pose, target offset, stiffness and
goal tolerances. The feasibility of the motion is subsequently validated by forward integration
of the closed-loop whole-body controller.\\
