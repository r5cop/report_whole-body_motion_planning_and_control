  abstract = {Robots executing practical tasks in real environments are often subject
	to multiple constraints. These constraints include orientation constraints:
	e.g., keeping a glass of water upright, torque constraints: e.g.,
	not exceeding the torque limits for an arm lifting heavy objects,
	visibility constraints: e.g., keeping an object in view while moving
	a robot arm, etc. Rejection sampling, Jacobian projection techniques
	and optimization-based approaches are just some of the methods that
	have been used to address such constraints while computing motion
	plans for robots performing manipulation tasks. In this work, we
	present an approach to handling certain types of constraints in a
	manner that significantly increases the efficiency of existing methods.
	Our approach focuses on the sampling step of a motion planner. We
	implement this step as the drawing of samples from a set that has
	been computed in advance instead of the direct sampling of constraints.
	We show how our approach can be applied to different constraints:
	orientation constraints on the end-effector of an arm, visibility
	constraints and dual-arm constraints. We present simulated results
	to validate our method, comparing it to approaches that use direct
	sampling of constraints.},

	Motion Planning by Interior-Exterior Cell Exploration (KPIECE), which

	is important. A grid-based discretization is used to estimate the

	the less covered parts of this boundary. Extensive experiments show

  abstract = {Purpose - The paper seeks to present a new generation of torque-controlled
	light-weight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics
	and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. Design/methodology/approach
	- An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented.
	Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness
	of planning and control with respect to environmental variations
	is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor
	redundancy and passivity-based control. In the DLR root concept,
	joint torque sensing plays a central role. Findings - In order to
	act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots
	have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish
	them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1:1,
	torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive
	collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level.
	Practical implications - The DLR robots are excellent research platforms
	for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical
	robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and
	hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial
	application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing
	activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant).
	The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also
	for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology
	was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first
	arms on the market in the near future. Originality/value - This paper
	introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and
	describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation
	in human environments. To the best of one's knowledge, the first
	systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot-human
	crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

	to effectively perform activities of daily living (ADLs) and overcome

	user-interface devices, including a Brain Computer Interface (BCI)

	personal robots towards open-ended sets of everyday manipulation
	tasks which involve high complexity and vague job specifications.
	To achieve this, we propose a control architecture that synergetically
	integrates some of the most promising artificial intelligence (AI)
	methods that we consider as necessary for the performance of everyday
	manipulation tasks in human living environments: deep representations,
	probabilistic first-order learning and reasoning, and transformational
	planning of reactive behavior all of which are integrated in a coherent
	high-level robot control system: Cogito. We demonstrate the strengths
	of this combination of methods by realizing, as a proof of concept,
	an autonomous personal robot capable of setting a table efficiently
	using instructions from the world wide web. To do so, the robot translates
	instructions into executable robot plans, debugs its plan to eliminate
	behavior flaws caused by missing pieces of information and ambiguities
	in the instructions, optimizes its plan by revising the course of
	activity, and infers the most likely job from vague job description
	using probabilistic reasoning. 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	the robots retrieve instructions for making pancakes from the World

	robots are much more flexible, reliable, and general than control
	programs that lack such cognitive capabilities. CRAM does not require
	the whole domain to be stated explicitly in an abstract knowledge
	base. Rather, it grounds symbolic expressions in the knowledge representation
	into the perception and actuation routines and into the essential
	data structures of the control programs. In the accompanying video,

	capabilities for mobile manipulation platforms, which produce legible
	behavior in human living environments. To achieve generality and
	legibility, we combine two control mechanisms. First of all, experience-
	and observation-based learning of skills is applied to routine tasks,
	so that the repetitive and stereotypical character of everyday activity
	is exploited. Second, we use planning, reasoning, and search for
	novel tasks which have no stereotypical solution. We apply these
	ideas to the learning and use of action-related places, to the model-based
	visual recognition and localization of objects, and the learning
	and application of reaching strategies and motions from humans. We
	demonstrate the integration of these mechanisms into a single low-level
	control system for autonomous manipulation platforms.},

	sampling-based method is able to find globally feasible solutions

  abstract = {Real-time replanning is a prerequisite for motion execution in unpredictably
	changing environments. This paper presents a framework that allows
	real-time re-planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces. Initially,
	a planning operation generates a path. The path is augmented by a
	set of paths homotopic to it. This set is represented implicitly
	by a volume of free space in the work space. Effectively, this corresponds
	to delaying part of the planning operation for the homotopic paths
	until motion execution. During execution reactive control algorithms
	are used to select a valid path from the set of homotopic paths,
	using proximity to the environment as a simple and effective heuristic
	and thereby significantly pruning the search in the configuration
	space. Experimental results are presented to validate the real-time
	performance of this framework in high-dimensional configuration spaces.},

	interactive tour-guide robot. It presents a modular and distributed
	software architecture, which integrates localization, mapping, collision
	avoidance, planning, and various modules concerned with user interaction
	and Web-based telepresence. At its heart, the software approach relies
	on probabilistic computation, on-line learning, and any-time algorithms.
	It enables robots to operate safely, reliably, and at high speeds
	in highly dynamic environments, and does not require any modifications
	of the environment to aid the robot's operation. Special emphasis
	is placed on the design of interactive capabilities that appeal to
	people's intuition. The interface provides new means for human-robot
	interaction with crowds of people in public places, and it also provides
	people all around the world with the ability to establish a "virtual
	telepresence" using the Web. To illustrate our approach, results
	are reported obtained in mid-1997, when our robot "RHINO" was deployed
	for a period of six days in a densely populated museum. The empirical
	results demonstrate reliable operation in public environments. The
	robot successfully raised the museum's attendance by more than 50%.
	In addition, thousands of people all over the world controlled the
	robot through the Web. We conjecture that these innovations transcend
	to a much larger range of application domains for service robots.},

  abstract = {El-E ("Ellie") is a prototype assistive robot designed to help people
	with severe motor impairments manipulate everyday objects. When given
	a 3D location, El-E can autonomously approach the location and pick
	up a nearby object. Based on interviews of patients with amyotrophic
	lateral sclerosis (ALS), we have developed and tested three distinct
	interfaces that enable a user to provide a 3D location to El-E and
	thereby select an object to be manipulated: an ear-mounted laser
	pointer, a hand-held laser pointer, and a touch screen interface.
	Within this paper, we present the results from a user study comparing
	these three user interfaces with a total of 134 trials involving
	eight patients with varying levels of impairment recruited from the
	Emory ALS Clinic. During this study, participants used the three
	interfaces to select everyday objects to be approached, grasped,
	and lifted off of the ground. The three interfaces enabled motor
	impaired users to command a robot to pick up an object with a 94.8%
	success rate overall after less than 10 minutes of learning to use
	each interface. On average, users selected objects 69% more quickly
	with the laser pointer interfaces than with the touch screen interface.
	We also found substantial variation in user preference. With respect
	to the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), users with
	greater upper-limb mobility tended to prefer the hand-held laser
	pointer, while those with less upper-limb mobility tended to prefer
	the ear-mounted laser pointer. Despite the extra efficiency of the
	laser pointer interfaces, three patients preferred the touch screen
	interface, which has unique potential for manipulating remote objects
	out of the user's line of sight. In summary, these results indicate
	that robots can enhance accessibility by supporting multiple interfaces.
	Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the communication of 3D
	locations during human-robot interaction can serve as a powerful
	abstraction barrier that supports distinct interfaces to assistive
	robots while using identical, underlying robotic functionality. Copyright

  abstract = {This report describes the creation of the service robot depicted in
	Figure 1. At the depart-
	
	ment of Mechanical Engineering of the Eindhoven University of Technology
	there was a need
	
	for such a robot for several projects like the RoboEarth project,
	the Bobbie project and for the
	
	RoboCup atHome competition. The robots design is based on a new design
	of the Tech United
	
	TURTLE. This platform has been equipped with two Philips Experimental
	Robotic Arms to be
	
	able to grasp objects in a household environment. Due to the lifting
	mechanism, the robot can
	
	pick objects from the
	
	oor as well as from a table. To drive around, the robot makes use
	of
	
	four omni wheels, making it a fully holonomic platform that is capable
	of navigating through
	
	wheelchair-accessible areas. The main reason of using four wheels
	is to prevent the robot from
	
	tipping over in the case of a sudden stop.
	
	Furthermore the robot is equipped with
	
	-a laser range nder, for a two dimensional view of the environment,
	
	- a Microsoft Kinect, for vision and three dimensional perception,
	
	- two EtherCAT stacks from Beckho that provide the communication
	with the hardware,
	
	- two Dynamixels, for the pan and tilt of the head and
	
	- three AOpen computers.
	
	The robot is going to use the Robotic Operating System. ROS is an
	open-source meta-operating
	
	system with already a lot of basic functionality for mobile manipulators
	available.
	
	Since the robot makes use of open-source software there was a need
	for a open-source control
	
	architecture. The OROCOS framework is chosen to provide this functionality.
	Several components
	
	have been written to ease future design of controllers. The components
	provide basic functionality
	
	like communicating with the hardware or do operations on signals.
	These components can be
	
	deployed using a single script to determine the layout of the control
	structure. By using this
	
	conguration the low-level control, which consists of separate controllers
	for each wheel, is achieved.
	
	The robot, named AMIGO, already performed in two successful demonstrators
	for RoboEarth and
	
	achieved 6th and 14th place in the RoboCup @Home competition in respectively
	the RoboCup
	
	German Open 2011 and the RoboCup World Cup 2011.

	for safe navigation. It is based on a representation framework that
	probabilistically fuses sensor measurements to represent the occupancy
	probability of volumes. To achieve safe navigation in a domestic
	environment this representation is extended with a model of the occupancy
	probability if no sensor measurements are received and a model to
	deal with unpredictably moving obstacles that can arise from behind
	occlusions by always expecting obstacles to appear on the robotís
	path. By combining the occupancy probability of volumes with the
	position uncertainty of the robot, a probability of collision is
	obtained. It is shown that by relating this probability to a safe
	velocity limit a robot in a real domestic environment can move close
	to a certain maximum velocity but decides to attain a slower safe
	velocity limit when it must, analogous to velocity limits and warning

	manipulation planner that does deal effectively with the high-dimensionality
	of the problem. The planner achieves the required efficiency due
	to the following three factors: (a) its use of informative yet fast-to-compute
	heuristics; (b) its use of basic (small) motion primitives as atomic
	actions; and (c) its use of ARA* search which is an anytime heuristic
	search with provable bounds on solution suboptimality. Our experimental
	analysis on a real mobile manipulation platform with a 7-DOF robotic

	Constraint weighting results in an invariant robot behavior in case

  abstract = {Society is becoming more automated with robots beginning to perform
	most tasks in factories and starting to help out in home and oce
	environments. One of the most important functions of robots is the
	ability to manipulate objects in their environment. because the space
	of possible robot designs, sensor modalities, and target tasks is
	huge, researchers end up having to manually create many models, databases,
	and programs for their specific task, an eort that is repeated whenever
	the task changes. Given a specification for a robot and a task, the
	presented framework automatically constructs the necessary databases
	and programs required for the robot to reliably execute manipulation
	tasks. It includes contributions in three major components that are
	critical for manipulation tasks.
	
	The first is a geometric-based planning system that analyzes all necessary
	modalities of manipulation planning and oers ecient algorithms
	to formulate and solve them. This allows identification of the necessary
	information needed from the task and robot specifications. Using
	this set of analyses, we build a planning knowledge-base that allows
	informative geometric reasoning about the structure of the scene
	and the robot's goals. We show how to efficiently generate and query
	the information for planners.
	
	The second is a set of efficient algorithms considering the visibility
	of objects in cameras when choosing manipulation goals. We show results
	with several robot platforms using grippers cameras to boost accuracy
	of the detected objects and to reliably complete the tasks. Furthermore,
	we use the presented planning and visibility infrastructure to develop
	a completely automated extrinsic camera calibration method and a
	method for detecting insufficient calibration data.
	
	The third is a vision-centric database that can analyze a rigid object's
	surface for stable and discriminable features to be used in pose
	extraction programs. Furthermore, we show work towards a new voting-based
	object pose extraction algorithm that does not rely on 2D/3D feature
	correspondences and thus reduces the early-commitment problem plaguing
	the generality of traditional vision-based pose extraction algorithms.
	
	
	In order to reinforce our theoric contributions with a solid implementation
	basis, we discuss the open-source planning environment OpenRAVE,
	which began and evolved as a result of the work done in this thesis.
	We present an analysis of its architecture and provide insight for
	successful robotics software environments.},

	Classical methods to integrate respective algorithms into task hierarchies

	law. We propose a new, reactive self-collision avoidance algorithm

	us to specifically limit the force/torque derivative to comply with

	No redundancy is wasted. No comparable algorithms have been developed

  abstract = {Mobile service robots in human environments need to have versatile
	abilities to perceive and to interact with their environment. Spoken
	language is a natural way to interact with a robot, in general, and
	to instruct it, in particular. However, most existing speech recognition
	systems often suffer from high environmental noise present in the
	target domain and they require in-depth knowledge of the underlying
	theory in case of necessary adaptation to reach the desired accuracy.
	We propose and evaluate an architecture for a robust speaker independent
	speech recognition system using off-the-shelf technology and simple
	additional methods. We first use close speech detection to segment
	closed utterances which alleviates the recognition process. By further
	utilizing a combination of an FSG based and an N-gram based speech
	decoder we reduce false positive recognitions while achieving high
	accuracy.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, particle filters have been applied with great
	success to a variety of state estimation problems. In this paper
	we present a statistical approach to increasing the efficiency of
	particle filters by adapting the size of sample sets during the estimation
	process. The key idea of the KLD-sampling method is to bound the
	approximation error introduced by the sample-based representation
	of the particle filter. The name KLD-sampling is due to the fact
	that we measure the approximation error using the Kullback-Leibler
	distance. Our adaptation approach chooses a small number of samples
	if the density is focused on a small part of the state space, and
	it chooses a large number of samples if the state uncertainty is
	high. Both the implementation and computation overhead of this approach
	are small. Extensive experiments using mobile robot localization
	as a test application show that our approach yields drastic improvements
	over particle filters with fixed sample set sizes and over a previously
	introduced adaptation technique.},

	limits, whenever these two objectives are compatible. This is obtained
	without having to rely upon trajectory planning. In the nonholonomic
	case this feature, which is not demonstrated for previous feedback
	control schemes proposed in the literature, is instrumental for performing
	reflex maneuvers automatically. It relies upon the concept, used
	in the control design, of a companion omnidirectional frame associated
	with the physical platform. The generality of the approach can be
	appreciated from its applicability to various nonholonomic platforms,
	for example unicycle-type and car-like.},

	of reaching and grasping an object in a cluttered environment with
	a humanoid robot. While finding an optimal grasp is often treated
	independently from reaching to the object, in most situations it
	depends on how the robot can reach a pregrasp pose while avoiding
	obstacles. We tackle this problem by introducing the concept of task
	maps which represent the manifold of feasible grasps for an object.
	Rather than defining a single end-effector goal position, a task
	map defines a goal hyper volume in the task space. We show how to
	efficiently learn such maps using the rapidly exploring random tree
	algorithm. Further, we generalise a previously developed motion optimisation
	scheme, based on a sequential attractor representation of motion,
	to cope with such task maps. The optimisation procedure incorporates
	the robotpsilas redundant whole body controller and uses analytic
	gradients to jointly optimise the motion costs (including criteria
	such as collision and joint limit avoidance, energy efficiency, etc.)
	and the choice of the grasp on the manifold of valid grasps. This
	leads to a preference of grasps which are easy to reach. The approach
	is demonstrated in two reach-grasp simulation scenarios with the
	humanoid robot ASIMO.},

  abstract = {Technical aids allow elderly and handicapped people to live independently
	and supported in their private homes for a longer time. As a contribution
	to such technological solutions, two demonstrator platforms for a
	robotic home assistant - called Care-O-bot - were designed and implemented
	at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart. Whereas Care-O-bot I is only a mobile
	platform with a touch screen, Care-O-bot II is additionally equipped
	with adjustable walking supporters and a manipulator arm. It has
	the capability to navigate autonomously in indoor environments, be
	used as an intelligent walking support, and execute manipulation
	tasks. The control software of Care-O-bot II runs on two industrial
	PCs and a hand-held control panel. The walking aid module is based
	on sensors in the walking aid handles and on a dynamic model of conventional
	walking aids. In "direct mode", the user can move along freely with
	the robot whereas obstacles are detected and avoided. In "planned
	mode", he can specify a target and be lead there by the robotic assistant.
	Autonomous planning and execution of complex manipulation tasks is
	based on a symbolic planner and environmental information provided
	in a database. The user input (graphical and speech input) is transferred
	to the task planner and adequate actions to solve the task (sequence
	of motion and manipulation commands) are created. A new method for
	sensor based manipulation using a tilting laser scanner and camera
	integrated in the head of the robot has been implemented. Additional
	sensors in the robot hand increase the grasping capabilities. The
	walking aid has been tested with elderly users from an assisted living
	facility and a nursery home. Furthermore, the execution of fetch
	and carry tasks has been implemented and tested in a sample home
	environment.},

  abstract = {A necessary attribute of a mobile robot planning algorithm is the
	ability to accurately predict the consequences of robot actions to
	make informed decisions about where and how to drive. It is also
	important that such methods are efficient, as onboard computational
	resources are typically limited and fast planning rates are often
	required. In this article, we present several practical mobile robot
	motion planning algorithms for local and global search, developed
	with a common underlying trajectory generation framework for use
	in model-predictive control. These techniques all center on the idea
	of generating informed, feasible graphs at scales and resolutions
	that respect computational and temporal constraints of the application.
	Connectivity in these graphs is provided by a trajectory generator
	that searches in a parameterized space of robot inputs subject to
	an arbitrary predictive motion model. Local search graphs connect
	the currently observed state-to-states at or near the planning or
	perception horizon. Global search graphs repeatedly expand a precomputed
	trajectory library in a uniformly distributed state lattice to form
	a recombinant search space that respects differential constraints.
	In this article, we discuss the trajectory generation algorithm,
	methods for online or offline calibration of predictive motion models,
	sampling strategies for local search graphs that exploit global guidance
	and environmental information for real-time obstacle avoidance and
	navigation, and methods for efficient design of global search graphs
	with attention to optimality, feasibility, and computational complexity
	of heuristic search. The model-invariant nature of our approach to
	local and global motions planning has enabled a rapid and successful
	application of these techniques to a variety of platforms. Throughout
	the article, we also review experiments performed on planetary rovers,
	field robots, mobile manipulators, and autonomous automobiles and
	discuss future directions o- the article.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that
	must achieve a specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion
	constraints while avoiding collision with moving obstacles with known
	trajectories. The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot
	with a control system and samples the robot's state ó time space
	by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations
	of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state
	ó time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories.
	The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning
	query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal
	state ó time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the
	planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state ó time space
	satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly
	idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find
	a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging
	to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested
	extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real
	robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions
	just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small,
	fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the
	expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes
	the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the
	fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the
	planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that
	are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the

	This article describes a novel method to learn from such data and

	The main idea is to use demonstrated optimal motions to quickly predict
	appropriate trajectories for novel situations. These can be used
	to initialize and thereby drastically speed-up subsequent optimization
	of robotic movements. Our approach has two essential ingredients.
	First, to generalize from previous situations to new ones we need
	a situation descriptor - we construct features for such descriptors
	and use a sparse regularized feature selection approach to improve
	generalization. Second, the transfer of previously optimized trajectories
	to a new situation should not be made in joint angle space - we propose
	a more efficient task space transfer. We present extensive results
	in simulation to illustrate the benefits of the new method, and demonstrate
	it also with real robot hardware. Our experiments in diverse tasks
	show that we can predict good motion trajectories in new situations

  abstract = {We present new techniques that use motion planning algorithms based
	on probabilistic roadmaps to control 22 degrees of freedom (DOFs)
	of human-like characters in interactive applications. Our main purpose
	is the automatic synthesis of collision-free reaching motions for
	both arms, with automatic column control and leg flexion. Generated
	motions are collision-free, in equilibrium, and respect articulation
	range limits. In order to deal with the high (22) dimension of our
	configuration space, we bias the random distribution of configurations
	to favor postures most useful for reaching and grasping. In addition,
	extensions are presented in order to interactively generate object
	manipulation sequences: a probabilistic inverse kinematics solver
	for proposing goal postures matching pre-designed grasps; dynamic
	update of roadmaps when obstacles change position; online planning
	of object location transfer; and an automatic stepping control to
	enlarge the character's reachable space. This is, to our knowledge,
	the first time probabilistic planning techniques are used to automatically
	generate collision-free reaching motions involving the entire body
	of a human-like character at interactive frame rates.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such
	as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees
	(RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical
	guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort
	has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution
	returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of
	samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously
	analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned
	by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples
	increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing
	existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions,
	the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based
	algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main
	contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms,
	namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal,
	i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost
	surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational
	complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that
	of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal)
	counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections
	between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the
	theory of random geometric graphs.},

  abstract = {We present a novel interface for human-robot interaction that enables
	a human to intuitively and unambiguously select a 3D location in
	the world and communicate it to a mobile robot. The human points
	at a location of interest and illuminates it ("clicks it") with an
	unaltered, off-the-shelf, green laser pointer. The robot detects
	the resulting laser spot with an omnidirectional, catadioptric camera
	with a narrow-band green filter. After detection, the robot moves
	its stereo pan/tilt camera to look at this location and estimates
	the location's 3D position with respect to the robot's frame of reference.
	Unlike previous approaches, this interface for gesture-based pointing
	requires no instrumentation of the environment, makes use of a non-instrumented
	everyday pointing device, has low spatial error out to 3 meters,
	is fully mobile, and is robust enough for use in real-world applications.
	We demonstrate that this human-robot interface enables a person to
	designate a wide variety of everyday objects placed throughout a
	room. In 99.4% of these tests, the robot successfully looked at the
	designated object and estimated its 3D position with low average
	error. We also show that this interface can support object acquisition
	by a mobile manipulator. For this application, the user selects an
	object to be picked up from the floor by "clicking" on it with the
	laser pointer interface. In 90% of these trials, the robot successfully
	moved to the designated object and picked it up off of the floor.

	software and hardware platform and thus can not be reused without
	modifications. This work follows the meta-model approach of Model
	Driven Engineering (MDE) to introduce the concepts of Domain Specific
	Languages (DSL) and of Model Transformations to the domain of hybrid
	force-velocity controlled robot tasks, as expressed in (i) the Task
	Frame formalism (TFF), and (ii) a Statechart model representing the
	discrete coordination between TFF tasks. The result is a representation
	in MDE's M0, M1, M2 and M3 form, with increasingly robot and software
	independent representations, that do remain instantaneously executable,
	except obviously for the M3 metametamodel. The Platform Specific
	Model information can be added in three steps: (i) the type of the
	hybrid force-velocity controlled task, (ii) the hardware properties
	of the robot, tool and sensor, and (iii) the software properties
	of the applied execution framework. We demonstrate the presented
	approach by means of an alignment task executed on a Willow Garage
	PR2 and a KUKA Light Weight Robot (LWR) arm.},

	First, based on previous work concerning agent systems, a conceptual
	framework of four broad categories is established, encompassing the

	evaluation of RDE usability in designing, implementing, and executing

	consists of generating a trajectory for the platform from a given

	method is to determine the redundant degrees of freedom of the mobile
	manipulator in order to minimize the value of performance index defined
	as a function of traveling distance, driving force, variation of
	joint velocity, and manipulability. Moreover, for tasks which require

	index to evaluate the direction of manipulating force enables generation
	of the trajectory on which the mobile manipulator has appropriate
	postures to exert a force on an object surface. Then, we describe
	a dynamic hybrid control method for the mobile manipulator, to control
	both the pushing force and the simultaneous positioning of the arm

  abstract = {A mobile manipulator can perform various tasks efficiently by utilizing
	mobility and manipulation functions. The coupling of these two functions
	creates a particular kinematic redundancy introduced by mobility,
	which is different from that introduced by extra joints. This redundancy
	is quite desirable for dexterous motion in cluttered environments,
	but it also significantly complicates the motion planning and control
	problem. In this paper we propose a new motion planning method for
	mobile manipulators to execute a multiple task which consists of
	a sequence of tasks. The task considered in this paper is that the
	end-effector tracks a prespecified trajectory in a fixed world frame.
	In a multiple task, the final configuration of each task becomes
	the initial configuration of the next subsequent task. Such a configuration
	is known as a commutation configuration, which significantly affects
	the performance of the multiple task. We formulate the motion planning
	problem as a global optimization problem and simultaneously obtain
	the motion trajectory set and commutation configurations. In the
	formulation, we take account of the case that the platform has a
	non-holonomic constraint as well as the one that the platform has
	a holonomic constraint. Simulation results are demonstrated to verify
	the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The Probabilistic Roadmap method (PRM) has been widely used in the
	field of robot path planning and based on it, a great number of variants
	have been developed addressing for different purposes, e.g. the Lazy
	PRM method, the Dynamic Roadmap (DRM) method, and the Dynamic Bridge
	Builder method (DBB). In this paper, PRM is extended as well - a
	hierarchical roadmap based rapid path planner is presented, which
	combines DRM with DBB to achieve good planning performance in environments
	including moveable obstacles. Through observation, we find that how
	to determine precise location of a robot's end-effector is quite
	important for nearly all practical planning tasks. Moreover, the
	workspace that can be swept by its end-effector determines scope
	of action of a robot. In consideration of the safety factor, the
	velocity of planning should be limited. Accordingly, its scope of
	action must be limited during a certain time interval, as well. In
	this paper, a hierarchy sampling strategy oriented towards the end-effector
	position is employed. Initially only a fundamental global roadmap
	is constructed and visible. Then the scope of a manipulator, called
	manipulator space in this paper, is computed. Moveable obstacles
	lying inside the manipulation space are used to update the global
	roadmap and activate other two layers of nodes with Dynamic Bridge
	Builder. The approach has been implemented and tested in simulation,
	and results show that it meets the real-time demand well.},

  abstract = {Path planning for mobile robots with high degree of freedom (DOF)
	is an extreme challenge. Although lots of algorithms have focused
	on the planning of fixed manipulators and mobile robots with low
	degree of freedom, seldom of them can be employed to deal with high
	DOF mobile agents. The unpredictable obstacles and too many freedoms
	increased computational complexity dramatically. In this paper, a
	novel and general real-time approach is introduced to solve this
	problem. The core of this approach can be divided into two phases.
	By locally employing Dynamic Roadmap Mapping, a mobile robot can
	seek a collision-free path locally without too much collision detection.
	And a hierarchy sampling strategy is employed to treat narrow passages.
	Based on the idea of Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree, a high-level
	guide is developed by randomly generating subgoals. These two phases
	collaborate to help generate a desired path. Experimental results
	show that our algorithm can find out a collision free path in real
	time for mobile robots with 15 DOF in complex environments in the
	presence of both stationary and changing obstacles.},

  abstract = {Previous work [1] shows that the movement representation in task spaces
	offers many advantages for learning object-related and goal-directed
	movement tasks through imitation. It allows to reduce the dimensionality
	of the data that is learned and simplifies the correspondence problem
	that results from different kinematic structures of teacher and robot.
	Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization,
	for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements
	are represented in relation to each other. Although task spaces are
	widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they are
	mostly defined a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic
	selection of task spaces. Observed movements are mapped into a pool
	of possibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods that
	analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space descriptors
	that match the observation best. As statistical measures cannot explain
	importance for all kinds of movements, the presented selection scheme
	incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based measure.
	Further, we introduce methods that make a significant step from purely
	statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based movement
	analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort and
	discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as a hint
	for important task elements. All methods are validated with real-world
	data, gathered using color tracking with a stereo vision system and
	a VICON motion capturing system.},

  number = {DEC},
  abstract = {In the last years, optimal control theory (OCT) has emerged as the
	leading approach for investigating neural control of movement and
	motor cognition for two complementary research lines: behavioral
	neuroscience and humanoid robotics. In both cases, there are general
	problems that need to be addressed, suchasthe "degrees offreedom
	(DoFs) problem," the common core of production, observation, reasoning,
	and learning of "actions." OCT, directly derived from engineering
	design techniques of control systems quantifies task goals as "cost
	functions" and uses the sophisticated formal tools of optimal control
	to obtain desired behavior (and predictions). We propose an alternative
	"softer" approach passive motion paradigm (PMP) that we believe is
	closer to the biomechanics and cybernetics of action.The basic idea
	is that actions (overt as well as covert) are the consequences of
	an internal simulation process that "animates" the body schema with
	the attractor dynamics of force fields induced by the goal and task-specific
	constraints.This internal simulation offers the brain a way to dynamically
	link motor redundancy with task-oriented constraints "at runtime,"
	hence solving the "DoFs problem" without explicit kinematic inversion
	and cost function computation. We argue that the function of such
	computational machinery is not only restricted to shaping motor output
	during action execution but also to provide the self with information
	on the feasibility, consequence, understanding and meaning of "potential
	actions." In this sense, taking into account recent developments
	in neuroscience (motor imagery, simulation theory of covert actions,
	mirror neuron system) and in embodied robotics, PMP offers a novel
	framework for understanding motor cognition that goes beyond the
	engineering control paradigm provided by OCT. Therefore, the paper
	is at the same time a review of the PMP rationale, as a computational
	theory, and a perspective presentation of how to develop it for designing
	better cognitive architectures.},

	of the robot's position in a large-scale global coordinate frame

	of these scales is often essential to the robot's purpose, each scale
	has different requirements in terms of state representation and handling

	a body-centric coordinate frame or a globally fixed coordinate frame
	for all state representation. Although both choices have advantages,
	we show that neither is ideal for a system that must handle both
	global and local data. This paper describes an alternative design:
	a third coordinate frame that stays fixed to the local environment
	over short time-scales, but can vary with respect to the global frame.
	Careful management of uncertainty in this local coordinate frame
	makes it well-suited for simultaneously representing both locally
	and globally derived data, greatly simplifying system design and
	improving robustness. We describe the implementation of this coordinate

  abstract = {Compliant control will be a prerequisite for humanoid robotics if
	these robots are supposed to work safely and robustly in human and/or

	should control a minimal number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) directly,
	i.e., those relevant DOFs for the task, and keep the remaining DOFs
	maximally compliant, usually in the null space of the task. This
	view naturally leads to task space control. However, surprisingly
	few implementations of task space control can be found in actual
	humanoid robots. This paper makes a first step towards assessing
	the usefulness of task space controllers for humanoids by investigating
	which choices of controllers are available and what inherent control
	characteristics they have - this treatment will concern position
	and orientation control, where the latter is based on a quaternion
	formulation. Empirical evaluations on an anthropomorphic Sarcos master
	arm illustrate the robustness of the different controllers as well
	as the ease of implementing and tuning them. Our extensive empirical
	results demonstrate that simpler task space controllers, e.g., classical
	resolved motion rate control or resolved acceleration control can
	be quite advantageous in face of inevitable modeling errors in model-
	based control, and that well chosen formulations are easy to implement

	service dogs to operate them. This method has the advantage of simplifying
	both the perception and physical interaction required to perform
	the task. It also enables the robot to use the same small set of
	behaviors to perform a variety of tasks across distinct doors and
	drawers. We report quantitative results for our assistive robot when
	performing assistive tasks in response to user commands in a modified
	environment. In our tests, the robot successfully opened two different
	drawers in 18 out of 20 trials (90%), closed a drawer in 9 out of
	10 trials (90%), and opened a door that required first operating
	a handle and then pushing it open in 8 out of 10 trials (80%). Additionally,
	the robot succeeded in single trial tests of opening a microwave,
	grasping an object, placing an object, delivering an object, and
	responding to various other commands, such as staying quiet. ¬© 2008

  abstract = {We introduce a new statistical modelling technique for building occupancy
	maps. The problem of mapping is addressed as a classification task
	where the robot's environment is classified into regions of occupancy
	and free space. This is obtained by employing a modified Gaussian
	process as a non-parametric Bayesian learning technique to exploit
	the fact that real-world environments inherently possess structure.
	This structure introduces dependencies between points on the map
	which are not accounted for by many common mapping techniques such
	as occupancy grids. Our approach is an 'anytime' algorithm that is
	capable of generating accurate representations of large environments
	at arbitrary resolutions to suit many applications. It also provides
	inferences with associated variances into occluded regions and between
	sensor beams, even with relatively few observations. Crucially, the
	technique can handle noisy data, potentially from multiple sources,
	and fuse it into a robust common probabilistic representation of
	the robot's surroundings. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach
	on simulated datasets with known ground truth and in outdoor urban
	environments.},

  abstract = {In order to operate in a clustered environment, a rehabilitation robot
	should have many degrees of freedom (DOF) and it should be redundant.
	Having a 7 DOF manipulator, the robotic system can skillfully support
	the user in every day life, but this introduces the problem of planning
	robot motions in real time. This paper introduces an efficient motion
	planning method for the 7 DOF manipulator. In order to avoid the
	computation complexity, typical for multidimensional joint space,
	the planning takes place in the Cartesian space. By using the graph
	based search, in combination with the fast inverse kinematics and
	with the checking of the manipulators ability to move without collision
	in each step, the approach is capable to escape the workspace dead-ends
	and it is also efficient enough for the practical usage. The resulting
	path is then smoothed or passed to the local planning method. Furthermore,
	the proposed approach enables neglecting the distant obstacles in
	the calculation of distances used in collision checking, which additionally
	decreases the overall computation time. The approach is implemented
	on the 7 DOF manipulator within the rehabilitation robotic system

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel type of impedance controllers for flexible
	joint robots is proposed. As a target impedance, a desired stiffness
	and damping are considered without inertia shaping. For this problem,
	two controllers of different complexity are proposed. Both have a
	cascaded structure with an inner torque feedback loop and an outer
	impedance controller. For the torque feedback, a physical interpretation
	as a scaling of the motor inertia is given, which allows to incorporate
	the torque feedback into a passivity-based analysis. The outer impedance
	control law is then designed differently for the two controllers.
	In the first approach, the stiffness and damping terms and the gravity
	compensation term are designed separately. This outer control loop
	uses only the motor position and velocity, but no noncollocated feedback
	of the joint torques or link side positions. In combination with
	the physical interpretation of torque feedback, this allows us to
	give a proof of the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system
	based on the passivity properties of the system. The second control
	law is a refinement of this approach, in which the gravity compensation
	and the stiffness implementation are designed in a combined way.
	Thereby, a desired static stiffness relationship is obtained exactly.
	Additionally, some extensions of the controller to viscoelastic joints
	and to Cartesian impedance control are given. Finally, some experiments
	with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) lightweight robots verify
	the developed controllers and show the efficiency of the proposed
	control approach. ¬© 2008 IEEE.},

	problem for robots with flexible joints is presented. The proposed
	controller structure is based on simple physical considerations,
	which are motivating the extension of classical position feedback
	by an additional feedback of the joint torques. The torque feedback
	action can be interpreted as a scaling of the apparent motor inertia.
	Furthermore the problem of gravity compensation is addressed. Finally,
	it is shown that the closed loop system can be seen as a feedback
	interconnection of passive systems. Based on these passivity property
	a proof of asymptotic stability is presented.},

	framework for the reactive control of wheeled mobile manipulators
	(WMM). Where most work in the literature often provides models, sometimes
	simplified, of a given type of WMM, an extensive description of obtaining
	explicit kinematic and dynamic models of those systems is given.
	This modelling framework is particularly well suited for reactive
	control approaches, which, in the case of mobile manipulation missions,
	are often necessary to handle the complexity of the tasks to be fulfilled,
	the dynamic aspect of the extended workspace and the uncertainties
	on the knowledge of the environment. A flexible reactive framework
	is thus also provided, allowing the sequencing of operational tasks
	(in our case, tasks described in the end-effector frame) whose natures
	are different but also an on-line switching mechanism between constraints
	that are to be satisfied using the system redundancy. This framework
	has been successfully implemented in simulation and on a real robot.
	Some of the obtained results are presented.},

	and distance-query algorithms, which can efficiently handle large

	computes a high-quality dynamic AABB tree for fast culling, and 2)
	we directly use an octree representation of the point cloud data
	as a proximity data structure. We assign a probability value to each
	leaf node of the tree, and the algorithm computes the nodes corresponding
	to high collision probability. In practice, our new approaches can
	be an order of magnitude faster than previous methods. We demonstrate
	the performance of the new methods on both synthetic data and on
	sensor data collected using a Kinect&#x2122; for motion planning

	uncertain, information such as object observations, shape, size,
	appearance of rooms and human input for semantic mapping. It abstracts
	multi-modal sensory information and integrates it with conceptual
	common-sense knowledge in a fully probabilistic fashion. It relies
	on the concept of spatial properties which make the semantic map
	more descriptive, and the system more scalable and better adapted
	for human interaction. A probabilistic graphical model, a chaingraph,
	is used to represent the conceptual information and perform spatial
	reasoning. Experimental results from online system tests in a large
	unstructured office environment highlight the system's ability to
	infer semantic room categories, predict existence of objects and
	values of other spatial properties as well as reason about unexplored
	space.},

  abstract = {Existing high-dimensional motion planning algorithms are simultaneously

	the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate ``narrow
	passages'' can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing
	is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths
	that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel
	method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient
	techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization
	technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge
	over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization
	strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility
	prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result,
	CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world
	planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
	method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as
	in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

  abstract = {One of the most important features of an advanced control system for
	articulated robots is the capability of transforming the work space
	coordinates, which naturally characterize any robot task, into the
	corresponding joint coordinates, on which control actions are developed.
	For each task, the coordinate transformation problem consists in
	calculating one trajectory in the joint space which corresponds to
	the end effector trajectory, usually given in the Cartesian space.
	While simple kinematical structures allow for closed-form solutions,
	there is a class of robots for which this is not true. Typical articulated
	robot structures have three revolute joints at the end effector;
	the geometric parameters of these joints actually determine the spatial
	configuration of the last axes of motion. The large majority of today's
	nonredundant structures have three intersecting axes at the end effector,
	and closed form solutions do exist in this case. If the axes intersect
	two-by-two, as in some rather common arm design, an exact solution
	seems not to exist. A quite different solution algorithm is established,
	as compared to the trigonometric approach widely adopted so far,
	which yields solutions in case of two-by-two intersecting axes. The
	convergence of the algorithm along any trajectory is proved. Effectiveness
	of the proposed technique can be argued by the fact that it only
	makes use of direct kinematics, thus resulting in a contained computational
	burden. A robot prototype of the kind described above is taken as
	a reference in order to discuss digital implementation and develop
	numerical examples.},

  abstract = {iTASC (acronym for 'instantaneous task specification and control')
	[1] is a systematic constraint-based approach to specify complex
	tasks of general sensor-based robot systems. iTASC integrates both
	instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty
	in a unified framework. Automatic derivation of controller and estimator
	equations follows from a geometric task model that is obtained using
	a systematic task modeling procedure. The approach applies to a large
	variety of robot systems (mobile robots, multiple robot systems,
	dynamic human-robot interaction, etc.), various sensor systems, and
	different robot tasks. Using an example task, this paper shows that
	iTASC is a powerful tool for multi-sensor integration in robot manipulation.
	The example task includes multiple sensors: encoders, a force sensor,
	cameras, a laser distance sensor and a laser scanner. The paper details
	the systematic modeling procedure for the example task and elaborates
	on the task specific choice of two types of task coordinates: feature
	coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which
	facilitate the task specification, and uncertainty coordinates to
	model geometric uncertainty. Experimental results for the example
	task are presented. ¬©2008 IEEE.},

	Over the past years several reactive techniques have been developed
	that use heuristic evaluation functions to choose appropriate actions
	whenever a robot encounters an unforeseen obstacle. Whereas the majority
	of these approaches determines only the next steering command, some
	additionally consider sequences of possible poses. However, they

	Accordingly, these methods are not able to slow down the robot early
	enough before it has to enter a narrow passage. In this paper we
	present a new approach that integrates path planning with sensor-based
	collision avoidance. Our algorithm simultaneously considers the robot's
	pose and velocities during the planning process. We employ different
	strategies to deal with the huge state space that has to be explored.
	Our method has been implemented and tested on real robots and in

	on many factors, such as the robot's hardware configuration, the
	controllers the robot uses to achieve navigation and manipulation,
	the task context, and uncertainties in state estimation. In this
	paper, we present 'ARPLACE', an action-related place which takes
	these factors, and the context in which the actions are performed
	into account. Through experience-based learning, the robot first
	learns a so-called generalized success model, which discerns between
	positions from which manipulation succeeds or fails. On-line, this
	model is used to compute a ARPLACE, a probability distribution that
	maps positions to a predicted probability of successful manipulation,
	and takes the uncertainty in the robot and object's position into
	account. In an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that using ARPLACEs
	for least-commitment navigation improves the success rate of subsequent
	manipulation tasks substantially. 2009 IEEE.},

	for robot systems. The representation space (RS) of a robot system
	is constructed to describe the distributions of system attributes.
	The reachable area in the RS, denoting the attribute set that the
	system can be of, indicates the system's ability to accomplish tasks.
	Moreover, it also describes the influences of the internal and external
	constraints on the system's capability. Task realization is transformed
	to finding a trajectory in the RS for the system attributes to transit
	along under constraints. Meanwhile, the realizable conditions of
	a prescribed task by the robot system of specific configurations
	are discussed. If the task is realizable, the optimal strategy for
	task execution could further be figured out. Otherwise, it could
	be transformed to be realizable via task reassignment or system reconfigurations
	so that a connected path could be found for the transition of the
	system attributes from the starting point to the goal in the RS.
	The proposed scheme contributes to designing, planning, and coordination
	of the robotic tasks. Experiments on path planning of a robot manipulator
	and formation movement of a multirobot system, as well as coordination
	of a mobile manipulator system, are conducted to show the validity
	and generalization of the proposed method.},

	The mobile manipulator is considered as a redundant robot, and a

	such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom
	(DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine
	the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position,
	i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both
	hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse
	kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation
	and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in
	the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling
	of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions
	at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods
	which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to
	dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object
	with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations
	suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we
	present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning
	algorithms (J +-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an
	IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the
	extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The
	capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both
	in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm
	tasks in a kitchen environment. © 2009 IEEE.},

	planning (RAMP) approach suitable for planning trajectories of high-DOF

	enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous

	optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria,

	The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion
	versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling
	of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance
	and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented
	and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments,
	including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results

  abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots need to use spatial information about the
	environment in order to effectively plan and execute navigation tasks.
	The information can be represented at different levels of abstraction,
	ranging from detailed geometric maps to coarse topological maps.
	Each level is adequate for some sub-task, but not for others. In
	this paper, we consider the representation of spatial knowledge at
	two different levels of abstraction, which are commonly considered
	in the robotics literature : the geometric level, and the topological
	level. We propose to represent the environment by local metric maps
	connected into a topological network. This technique allows us to
	use maps that are not metrically consistent on the global scale,
	although they are metrically consistent locally. The structure allows
	also the combination of abstract global reasoning and precise local
	geometric computations. Moreover, this structure reflects the typical
	organization of indoor environments, where rooms and hallways define
	independent but connected local working spaces. To navigate in the
	environment, the robot uses the topological information to plan a
	sequence of sectors to traverse, and uses the metric information
	in each sector to locally move within the sector and to the next
	one. The functioning of the proposed system with respect to omnidirectional
	mobile robots and results of simulated experiments are presented.},

	Based on the moving characteristic of table tennis, a sort of 3-RPUR+RP

	method and XYZ Euler angle, the kinematic inverse solution of the

	conveniently. The pose control equation is deduced, which can transform
	the racket pose in working space into the parameters of the driving
	axis in joint space. By using ADAMS software, the motion simulation
	is performed so as to prove the theoretical analysis effectively.
	The basic algorithm lays the theoretical foundation for the successful
	5-axis simultaneous control of the table tennis robot.},
