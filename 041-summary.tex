Whole-body control is a promising control method for domestic service robots. However, since whole-body control is a potential field-based method, it only operates at a local scope and it might therefore be unable to find a global solution in a complex environment with local minima. Therefore, to integrate a whole-body controller with a task executer, a planner is required that
provides connectivity information at a global scope while constraining only the DoFs that are relevant for the (sub-task) at hand.
The contribution of this work is to apply a topological planner for manipulation, where the topological graph is an abstract representation of possible robot configurations that describes possible sequences of motions.
All nodes in the topological graph are grounded to specific end-effector attractors. Each attractor can constrain up to six DoFs and possesses a number of properties, such as the target pose, target offset, stiffness and goal tolerances. The feasibility of the motion is subsequently validated by forward integration of the closed-loop whole-body controller.
